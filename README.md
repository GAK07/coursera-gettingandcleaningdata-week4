The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. it's a script downloading, unzipping and opening files. Calculating means and SD, then merging, changing columns names and writing a final dataframe.
